            The arrow shows whether the correct author was born earlier (‚¨ÖÔ∏è) or
            later (‚û°Ô∏è) than your guess. The year distance tells you
            approximately how many years apart they were born. For example, if
            you guess &quot;Emily Dickinson&quot; and see &quot;~50 years
            ‚û°Ô∏è&quot;, the correct author was born ~50 years after Emily

            The proximity percentage shows how close your guess is based on

            years apart), you&apos;ll get a low percentage. If you guess the
            correct author, you&apos;ll get 100%. This percentage helps gauge
            how close you are to the answer.

            Verse, as a general term, is often used as a synonym for poetry,
            distinguishing it from prose. Verse refers to metrical writing,
            which differs from regular language in its unique pattern of sounds
            and rhythms. We also use the term verse when we talk about songs!
            Versedle includes poetry, songs, and even some prose, too. The name
            celebrates the literary tradition of verse and the challenge of
            identifying authors through their distinctive writing styles.
