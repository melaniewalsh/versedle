Man never is, but always to be blest:
The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,

Indeed, I was a few months older than Cheerios
for today, the newspaper announced,
was the seventieth birthday of Cheerios
whereas mine had occurred earlier in the year.

Already I could hear them whispering
behind my stooped and threadbare back,
Why that dude’s older than Cheerios

Why that’s as old as the hills,
only the hills are much older than Cheerios
or any American breakfast cereal,
and more noble and enduring are the hills,

AR,Adrienne Rich,1929,2012,Aunt Jennifer's Tigers,"Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen,
Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.
They do not fear the men beneath the tree;
They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.

Aunt Jennifer's finger fluttering through her wool
Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.
The massive weight of Uncle's wedding band
Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand.

When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie
Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.
The tigers in the panel that she made
Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Adrienne_Rich_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Adrienne_Rich_%28cropped%29.jpg,https://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/rich-jennifer-tiger.html
SH,Seamus Heaney,1939,2013,Digging,"Between my finger and my thumb   
The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.

Under my window, a clean rasping sound   
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:   
My father, digging. I look down

Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds   
Bends low, comes up twenty years away   
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   
Where he was digging.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Seamus_Heaney%2C_Irish_poet%2C_brightened_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Seamus_Heaney%2C_Irish_poet%2C_brightened_%28cropped%29.jpg,
DT,Dylan Thomas,1914,1953,Do Not Get Gentle Into That Good Night,"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bc/Dylan_Thomas_photo.jpg,

PLA,Philip Larkin,1922,1985,This Be the Verse,"They fuck you up, your mum and dad.   
    They may not mean to, but they do.   
They fill you with the faults they had
    And add some extra, just for you.

But they were fucked up in their turn
    By fools in old-style hats and coats,   
Who half the time were soppy-stern
    And half at one another’s throats.

Man hands on misery to man.
    It deepens like a coastal shelf.
Get out as early as you can,
    And don’t have any kids yourself.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Philip_Larkin_in_a_library.gif,

The parish of rich women, physical decay,
Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/AudenVanVechten1939.jpg/330px-AudenVanVechten1939.jpg,
RHA,Robert Hayden,1913,1980,Those Winter Sundays,"Sundays too my father got up early
and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,
then with cracked hands that ached
from labor in the weekday weather made
banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.

I’d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.
When the rooms were warm, he’d call,
and slowly I would rise and dress,
fearing the chronic angers of that house,

Speaking indifferently to him,
who had driven out the cold
and polished my good shoes as well.
What did I know, what did I know
of love’s austere and lonely offices?",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/Robert_Hayden.jpg,

A widening deepening greenness,

It enters the dark hole of the head.
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
The page is printed.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/Ted_Hughes.jpeg/330px-Ted_Hughes.jpeg,
